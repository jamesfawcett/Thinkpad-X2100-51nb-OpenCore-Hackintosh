## Instructions

I will improve on this section if it is helpful? Please let me know! Full install guide is available in the [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/extended/kernel-issues.html#stuck-on-eb-log-exitbs-start)

- Download the EFI
- Generate SMBIOS for MacBookPro15,2 and put the values in config.plist. 

Alternativly, open the config.plist with [OpenCore Configurator](https://github.com/notiflux/OpenCore-Configurator) and generate the values automatically. Check coverage and make sure the serial IS NOT VALID if you want iMessage to work ;) I also recommend [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool), it's super helpful for mounting EFI files and debugging.
